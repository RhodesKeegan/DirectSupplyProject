0,,,,We had a 4 season sunroom addition built last fall that has a armana heat pump ptac unit. The last few days I’ve noticed a musty smell from the unit. The filters are clean and I don’t know what else to check. Any recommendations on what to look for (as well as specifics on how to do so)? Thanks,,,,,,,"Nu-Calgon 4171-75 Evap Foam No Rinse Evaporator Coil Cleaner, 18 oz. - Replacement Refrigerator Motors - Amazon.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",,,,,,,"In my previous home (small condo) I had a PTAC unit, Amana brand, looked the same as yours. Shortly before selling it, my bro and I took out the entire unit and cleaned it. It was actually quite easy. I got a couple cans of coil cleaner (green can I think) from Home Depot. After removing the cover, we unplugged it, removed the screws around the sleeve and it just pulled out. Took it outside and put it on some saw horses, sprayed down the coils and let is sit a bit with the cleaner. I think we also used a few brushes to really get in there (very gently as to not mess up the fins). I used a hose with just low pressure and cleaned them and the pan, just had to be careful where we got the water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

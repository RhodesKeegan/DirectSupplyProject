Is there an over the counter coil cleaner that will have the same power that the ultra be clean that we use does?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Monthly Maintenance,"Monthly maintenance of your Amana PTAC is a fairly simple process, and, for the most part, all a matter of making sure your unit’s filters and vents are clean. Follow the instructions below:",,Amana PTAC Maintenance & Cleaning: A Reference Guide,,
1,,,"Remove your unit’s filters by pulling them up and out the front of the unit, as shown in the graphic above. Run the filters under the tap and let dry completely on a towel before inserting the filters back into the unit. Using a vacuum to clean lint, dust, and dirt from the filters is an effective method, as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yearly Maintenance,"A “deep clean” and inspection of your PTAC unit should be conducted once a year. Certain environmental factors may require your unit to be deep cleaned more frequently, and if you reside near a dusty construction site or sea coast, for example, you should schedule inspection and thorough maintenance four times a year. Other local conditions can cause fungi to build up in the unit, and when such material dries around the inner workings of your PTAC it poses a fire hazard. Familiarize yourself with the kinds of spores and other airborne particles that can cause foreign material build-up in your area, and schedule deep cleaning maintenance accordingly.",,,,
2,,,"When replacing the air filters after cleaning them for an Amana PTAC unit, does the “smooth” side of the air filter face the front (toward the room intake) and the side with the “ridged” plastic frame protruding face the rear, toward the wall?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,,,Yes as the above question asks. Which way is the filter supposed to go. Does the molded grab part face toward the front of the unit or the back. Thank you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

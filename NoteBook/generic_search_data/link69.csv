0,,,"“No air gets through, we had to install an air exchanger just to filter stale air out of the house,” – Jones told us.",,,,,,,,,,,Operate by blowing air over heated or cooled coils,,,"You are standing in your tiny home in the summer on an 87 degree day. It is quite hot and muggy; the unit has been off. You turn the unit on. The fan whirs and the air begins to be conditioned via the refrigeration process. Step 1: The system refrigerant (commonly Freon or Puron) begins the cycle in a gaseous state. The compressor pumps the refrigerant gas up to a high pressure and temperature, compressing it. Step 2: The gas enters a heat exchanger where it loses heat to the outside world, cools, and condenses into a liquid via the condenser. Note: the liquid is cold in this phase of the cycle. Step 3: The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it evaporates. As it does so, it absorbs heat from the inside air (where it is hot and muggy), returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle- effectively cooling your tiny home.

0,Changing/Cleaning the Filter,,"Typically, your filter should be changed out or cleaned (if reusable) every 30 days. When your filter goes unchanged for longer than that, it collects a thick layer of dust and other pollutants. These pollutants then build up on the filter and blow off into the air stream. This buildup also restricts airflow through the filter and the coils, causing undue pressure on the compressor. Over time, this pressure shortens the life of your compressor, which can make for a costly repair.",,,,,Frozen Coils,,"Most of the time, if the unit is leaking or spitting water, it isn’t installed correctly. During the cooling process, PTACs will create condensation on the coils. That condensation then drips off into a drain pan at the bottom of the unit. If installed correctly into the wall sleeve, the unit should be tilted slightly backward by a few degrees so that water in the pan drains to the outside. ",,,,,,,"A unit that is tilted slightly forward may allow the fan to blow water droplets through the front grill. Otherwise, it might simply leak out of the bottom of the unit onto the floor. To fix this, start by checking the angle of your unit and tilting it back if necessary. While different manufacturers have their own recommendations, angling your unit about 2° toward the outside is often a best practice.",,,,,,Most Common Repairs,"Your PTAC unit won’t last forever, but that doesn’t mean it can’t serve your space for a long time.

1,,,"As outside air continues to blow through the refrigerant coils, they can build up dust and debris just like the air filter. For this reason, it’s important to clean the coils on your PTAC unit at least once every year (if not every six months). This prevents them from freezing or creating pressure on other parts of the unit from restricted airflow.",,,,,Cleaning the Coils,,"If you’ve ever seen icicles on the back of an AC unit, then you’ve likely seen a unit with frozen refrigerant coils. If this happens, your PTAC unit will often stop cooling or freeze up water in the drain pan and cause excess water to leak from the bottom.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Less Common Repairs,"This is also the case for repairing units with a non-digital display, or those that operate using bit switches. For both digital and non-digital PTAC units, our repair technicians at PTAC4Less follow a manual troubleshooting process in which they check all of the features of the machine until they find the problem. That process looks something like this: ",,,,Less Common Repairs,,,"Other problems related to moisture and improper maintenance may not happen as often if you take good care of your unit. However, there is still a chance you might encounter them one day. Here are a few less common repairs you’ll want to consider during troubleshooting.",,,,
2,,,,,,,,,,"Refrigerant coils typically freeze because they haven’t been cleaned in a long time. If this is the case, you simply need to take the unit outside and clean the coils before reinstalling it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"After this, our repair technicians will check some of the most important mechanical parts and make sure they are working properly: ",,,,,,,"The compressor is often the toughest part of your PTAC unit. In fact, it should last the full lifespan of your unit unless it gets damaged or poor maintenance affects its performance.",,,,
3,,,,,,,,,,"In other cases, it might be an issue with a small refrigerant leak. If you’re able to patch up the coils yourself, you can install a piercing valve on the suction side of your unit to add more refrigerant. Then, you will need to weld it together afterward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Be sure to check the owner’s manual for your PTAC model. Troubleshooting steps will often be listed there from the manufacturer along with some common repair scenarios.,,,,,,,"Although knowing how to repair a PTAC unit is useful information, good maintenance practices will help preserve the longevity of your unit and prevent the need for extra repairs. In fact, a well-maintained PTAC unit should last 18 to 20 years.",,,,
4,,,,,,,,,,"When we repair coil leaks at our facilities, our technicians will cut off the line to the leaking side of the coils to install an access port. We will then fill the unit with more refrigerant and clamp it back up using a pinching tool. This pinching tool allows us to weld up the hole and seal it tight. When it’s complete, these units come out looking factory-new.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Once you’ve run through the basic troubleshooting steps, you might be able to diagnose the problem on your own.

7,,,,,,,,,,"While you don’t necessarily need to take your PTAC unit outside to clean the coils, it is a messy process that’s far easier to manage outdoors. It’s good to use a cleaning solution in addition to warm water. Any off-the-shelf cleaning product will work, but you want to make sure the cleaner is made specifically for HVAC parts.

Many repair technicians would agree that repairing a constant refrigerant leak can be nearly impossible. While a small leak is often manageable, a large or persistent leak that continues to happen for weeks (even after initial repairs) is often not worth fixing. ",,,,,,,,,,,

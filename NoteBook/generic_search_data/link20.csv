As you use your air conditioner or PTAC it removes moisture in the air through the evaporator coil, besides pulling warm air into the unit it pulls microbes and dust particles through it as well. As it does this the water runs down the coil to the base pan where it usually collects on a maintained unit it would drain out to the rear of the unit and then outside. ",Ice-Air Vertical Exposed FCU (FAN COIL UNITS),,,Fan motor is oiled,,,"An air conditioning system has two coils, condenser coil and evaporator coil usually made of copper tubes with aluminum fins. The evaporator coil, or indoor coil, is often described as the ""cold"" coil because it provides indoor cooling. The coil works by absorbing heat from the indoor air that is blown over by the air handler's fan. The condenser coil or outdoor coil is the ""warm"" coil as it rejects the heat as a fan blows outside air over the surface.

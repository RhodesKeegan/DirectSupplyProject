Air conditioners can also humidify, purify and ventilate the air inside a room. This has many advantages because it eliminates dust particles and dust mites which can cause respiratory diseases. Air conditioners also help filter out allergens like pollen which can cause serious allergic reactions and provoke diseases such as asthma. Air conditioners also help keep humidity on a low. Rooms that have high humidity often promote the propagation of harmful bacteria which can cause serious respiratory diseases.",,,,,,,"In dusty or corrosive environments such as near construction sites or salt water, cleaning must be performed more often, sometimes up to four times a year.

This process usually requires that the PTAC system be removed from the wall and taken to a remote work area. The chemicals used to clean coils can be toxic. If they are applied to the PTAC system in a guestroom, the chemicals could get onto carpeting, curtains or upholstered surfaces. This could be dangerous for future guests and it could damage the fabric.",,,,,,,"PTAC filters, fans, fan shrouds, drain passages and base pans can be cleaned with basic equipment — bristle brushes, towels and vacuum cleaners are usually sufficient.

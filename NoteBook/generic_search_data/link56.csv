			I know these units have filters, but the coils need to be cleaned out on a regular basis as well.  I clean about 50 units at a local hotel and I use compressed steam to blow the coils clean.  The bottom pic looks like a lot of crud in the coils.  Thinking reduced air flow could be an issue.

			the top steam coil looks pretty old and dirty and may be restricting discharge air into the room. are you running it at the ""HI"" fan spend? also does the unit short cycle? meaning is it constantly shutting off then back on for a short period and then off again?

			Ok... I had the living room one serviced last summer. It was supposedly taken in for a full chemical cleaning. And yet, today I had it running all day long and still I was sweating this evening while in that room. And this was after dark. On that unit, the coils are sparkling clean. Intake screen spotless. Shouldn't be this way. I've got a call in to a repair company, but I fear I'll end up spending a lot more money only to be back in the same spot again. Frustrating!

			Yes, the coils do have some dust trapped in there that I'm unable to get out with a vacuum cleaner. Do you think a shop vac could do that job? The coils are also fairly bent. Maybe that part just needs to be replaced?

			Hi. This particular unit heats fairly well. One of my other units was having a heating problem similar to yours a few years ago. Turned out the air blowing over the coil was coming out too forcefully, and causing the coil not to heat all the way. I had to have a dimmer switch put on the fan in the unit, so that in the winter I could turn the fan speed down. At low speeds, the coil heated up just fine. I have no idea whether this might be the case for your unit as well, but that was my story. Hope you get it fixed - this stuff can be uber frustrating!

			Thanks, Furd. The screen wasn't too bad actually - I just vacuumed it again, but really not too much lint/dirt in there... The fins on the coils seems to be the main issue. I can look around now for a fin comb now, but do you think it'd make more sense to just have the thing professionally cleaned?

			on that AC side, you should have demanded ALL your money back OR have them to return and fix it properly and insist they send their best tech.  The ultimate test of an AC unit.  You should have the fan speed on high and measure the temperature difference entering the unit and comparing it to the output of the unit.  If its not at least 17-21 F colder, its not working to capacity.  I have seen some reach 30F differential on cap tube systems but if its 17-21F its max'd out and you need to do other things like white shades instead of black ones that absorb lots of heat.  I've had customers actuall lay styrofoam against windows to reduce the load in the space ( a cheap fix from HD) and tint windows... Like the car stuff,,,if its 80F in the apartment, it should kick out about 65F +/- 3F, just make sure its not pulling in outdoor air into it.  Some PTAC units have a damper for outdoor air. Make sure its closed.

		",,,,,,,"I have an extremely old HEIL a/c unit outside...the fan stopped working and was humming.....i was able to push it and it would start, so i replaced the capacitor with the same kind....7.5uf 440v.....not a dual....when replaced the fan still humming and i started it....the compressor is working i believe...and it is blowing hot.....but still not kicking off the fan when turned on...my question is could the capacitor i bought have been blown by the first attempt or perhaps it is just defective....i didnt have a multimeter at the time and tested both the old and new post swap out with no readings.....if it did blow it...is it possible for me to just push the fan and run as i need until the compressor does go.....such as heat the house and just turn off a/c till needed again.....i live in florida so it's not too crucial as of yet...basically it is not economically feasible to be replaced at this time so i tried a cheap fix for it....anyhow any help is completely appreciated....thanks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

			By the way - the coil in the picture I posted is actually the heating coil, and not attached to the PTAC unit. The coils on the AC were perfectly clean.
		",,,,,,,"I have an older amana unit.  when I came home from work tonight the inside unit blower was running and outside was not.  I reset all the breakers and outside unit turns on and 7 seconds later turns off.  inside unit continues to run.  over the last 3 years I have replaced the inside blower motor and fan, one of the circuit boards on the inside unit, the capacitor on the outside unit and the compressor fan motor as well as having to add another cap when I replaced that fan motor.  The unit was not very well taken care off before I bought the house and I was told by a tech that the unit was on its way out when I replaced the compressor fan motor, something about pressures being off etc. about 3 or 4 months ago.  Anyway, the compressor and fan turn on with the contactor engaging, then after 7 seconds the contactor disengages and it turns off, after a few minutes this repeats,  I'm assuming it did this all day until it stopped doing it for some reason but I didnt want to allow it to continue so I turned the tstat off.  any suggestions? thanks in advance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

			Here's the reason I think I must use the type of unit in the pic attached... My ac and heat come from the same unit. The heating coils (for steam heat) are in place above the unit and the units blow air over the coils for heat in the winter. Additionally, my units are 36"" wide and it seems most of the ones I see online are larger than that. If units like what I need can be had for $800 online, please give me a link. Thanks!

			what is the model # of your existing Ice Cap unit? there are a few different versions and variations of the 36"" and how it fits into the sleeve, you will want to make sure you are ordering the correct version or else you will have problems fitting the new unit into the sleeve as an exact fit. also keep in mind that the building is supplying the steam heat through the coil at their expense so your only electric bill liability In heating mode is running the indoor blower motor which is minimal. if you convert to electric heat, you will then be paying the electric heat in your bill during heating operation...just something to keep in mind.

			Yes, the steam heating coil is definitely old and dirty. Doesn't seem to be hindering the air too much, but I may look into replacing it. And true re: electric heat. My preference is to find a unit that can use the building's steam. Talking with someone who might be able to sell me a unit now.

0,,,,,,,Water Filter Finder,,,,,,,,,,"If your air conditioner will not turn on and you have confirmed that the power source is good, the problem may be the electronic control board, also known as a PCB assembly. This part is commonly used in window air conditioner units to help control the various parts. A sign that the control board is not working is the fan or compressor circuits not turning on. Check the control board for a blown fuse, first consulting your user manual to ensure your control board has an internal fuse. Replace your control board with a board with the same specifications.",,,,,,More Repair Parts,Click a Part Below to Start Your Repair:,"We'll send you expert repair help, discounts, and more!",,,Instant Repairmanâ„¢,,,,,,,

2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Your air conditioner may not turn on because of a faulty power cord interrupting the power supply. Test the outlet you are using with a different appliance to make sure it is supplying power. Visually inspect the power cord for signs of damage such as fraying. If your window air conditioner is on the newer side, it should feature a circuit breaker in the power cord; check to see if the breaker has tripped. If everything appears normal, remove the cabinet and use a multi-meter to test the terminal strip for voltage. Do not attempt to repair the power cord, replace it if it is faulty.",,,,Appliance Repair,,,,,,,

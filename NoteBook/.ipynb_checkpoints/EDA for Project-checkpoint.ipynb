actually draw air out through the vent door on the leeward negative pressure side of the building be able to condition the intended outside ventilation air through the vent door during occupied modes air pathways to the occupied space in most ptac models do not encourage outside air to pass through the indoor coil if any air is even introduced before being supplied to the room see figure the ptac fan must operate at all times when the room is occupied for ventilation or when the toilet exhaust is operating for pressurization regardless of what the guest desires guest control of the ptac can

for longer than that it collects a thick layer of dust and other pollutants these pollutants then build up on the filter and blow off into the air stream this buildup also restricts airflow through the filter and the coils causing undue pressure on the compressor over time this pressure shortens the life of your compressor which can make for a costly repair frozen coils most of the time if the unit is leaking or spitting water it isn t installed correctly during the cooling process ptacs will create condensation on the coils that condensation then drips off into a drain pan at the bottom of the unit if installed correctly into the wall sleeve the unit should be tilted slightly backward by a few degrees so that water in the pan drains to the outside a unit that is tilted slightly forward may allow the fan to blow water droplets through the front grill otherwise it might simply leak out of the bottom of the unit onto the floor to fix this start by checking the angle of your unit and tilting it back if necessary while different manufacturers have their own recommendations angling your unit about toward the outside is often a best practice most common repairs your ptac unit won t last forever but that doesn t mean it can t serve your space for a long time in addition to repairs continued maintenance will help extend the life of your unit for years to come let s look at how you

life of your unit for years to come let s look at how you can diagnose and repair your unit the best maintenance practices for ptacs and when you need to call a technician for help continued maintenance advice as outside air continues to blow through the refrigerant coils they can build up dust and debris just like the air filter for this reason it s important to clean the coils on your ptac unit at least once every year if not every six months this prevents them from freezing or creating pressure on other parts of the unit from restricted airflow cleaning the coils if you ve ever seen icicles on the back of an ac unit then you ve likely seen a unit with frozen refrigerant coils if this happens your ptac unit will often stop cooling or freeze up water in the drain pan and cause excess water to leak from the bottom less common repairs this is also the case for repairing units with a non digital display or those that operate using bit switches for both digital and non digital ptac units our repair technicians at ptac less follow a manual troubleshooting process in which they check all of the features of the machine until they find the problem that process looks something like this less common repairs other problems related to moisture and improper maintenance may not happen as often if you take good care of your unit however there is still a chance you might encounter them one day here are a few less common repairs you ll want to consider during troubleshooting refrigerant coils typically freeze because they haven t been cleaned in a long time if this is the case you simply need to take the unit outside and clean the coils before reinstalling it after this our repair technicians will check some of the most important mechanical parts and make sure they are working properly the compressor is often the toughest part of your ptac unit in fact it should last the full lifespan of your unit unless it gets damaged or poor maintenance affects its performance in other cases it might be an issue with a small refrigerant leak if you re able to patch up the coils yourself you can install a piercing valve on the suction side of your unit to add more refrigerant then you will need to weld it together afterward be sure to check the owner s manual for your ptac model troubleshooting steps will often be listed there from the manufacturer along with some common repair scenarios although knowing how to repair a ptac unit is useful information good maintenance practices will help preserve the longevity of your unit and prevent the need for extra repairs in fact a well maintained ptac unit should last to years when we repair coil leaks at our facilities our technicians will cut off the line to the leaking side of the coils to install an access port we will then fill the unit with more refrigerant and clamp it back up using a pinching tool this pinching tool allows us to weld up the hole and seal it tight when it s complete these units come out

should be changed out or cleaned if reusable every days when your filter goes unchanged for longer than that it collects a thick layer of dust and other pollutants these pollutants then build up on the filter and blow off into the air stream this buildup also restricts airflow through the filter and the coils causing undue pressure on the compressor over time this pressure shortens the life of your compressor which can make for a costly repair since most modern control boards are solid state repairing the control board itself is not worth the time or effort required it s best to replace the entire control board which you can do without taking the unit out of the wall as outside air continues to blow through the refrigerant coils they can build up dust and debris just like the air filter for this reason it s important to clean the coils on your ptac unit at least once every year if not every six months this prevents them from freezing or creating pressure on other parts of the unit from restricted airflow other problems related to moisture and improper maintenance may not happen as often if you take good care of your unit however there is still a chance you might encounter them one day here are a few less common repairs you ll want to consider during troubleshooting while you don t necessarily need to take your ptac unit outside to clean the coils it is a messy process that s far easier to manage outdoors it s good to use a cleaning solution in addition to warm water any off the shelf cleaning product will work but you want to make sure the cleaner is made specifically for hvac parts although it s usually best to use a more potent cleaner you may want to opt for a mild product if you choose to clean the coils inside when we repair coil leaks at our facilities our

or debris is removed leave the cleaner on the coils for the amount of time specified in the cleaner directions then spray it off with a low pressure hose be careful not to use high water pressure as this could damage the coils although knowing how to repair a ptac unit is useful information good maintenance practices will help preserve the longevity of your unit and prevent the need for extra repairs in fact a well maintained ptac unit should last to years things like mulch brush leaves and paint can all get lodged in the back of the coils and clog them up this also makes it more difficult for air to flow through the unit creating extra pressure on the compressor and shortening its lifespan while you can still decorate the outside of your building be sure to either complete those

coils causing undue pressure on the compressor over time this pressure shortens the life of your compressor which can make for a costly repair this is because refrigerant leaks originate in the coils on the back of the unit due to the way coils are constructed finding the location of the leak can be a real challenge unless you are able to change out the coils yourself this is usually a professional repair job even then you are probably better off to scrap the unit and purchase a new or refurbished unit for around the same price although many parts on your ptac can simply be replaced some problems are just too difficult to fix many repair technicians would agree that repairing a constant refrigerant leak can be nearly impossible while a small leak is often manageable a large or persistent leak that continues to happen for weeks even after initial repairs is often not worth fixing this is because refrigerant leaks originate in the coils on the back of the unit due to the way coils are constructed finding the location of the leak can be a real challenge unless you are able to change out the coils yourself this is usually a professional repair job even then you are probably

able to push it and it would start so i replaced the capacitor with the same kind uf v not a dual when replaced the fan still humming and i started it the compressor is working i believe and it is blowing hot but still not kicking off the fan when turned on my question is could the capacitor i bought have been blown by the first attempt or perhaps it is just defective i didnt have a multimeter at the time and tested both the old and new post swap out with no readings if it did blow it is it possible for me to just push the fan and run as i need until the compressor does go such as heat the house and just turn off a c till needed again i live in florida so it s not too crucial as of yet basically it is not economically feasible to be replaced at this time so i tried a cheap fix for it anyhow any help is completely appreciated thanks by the way the coil in the picture i posted is actually the heating coil and not attached to the ptac unit the coils on the ac were perfectly clean i have an older amana unit when i came home from work tonight the inside unit blower was running and outside was not i reset all the breakers and outside unit turns on and seconds later turns off inside unit continues to run over the last years i have replaced the inside blower motor and fan one of the circuit boards on the inside unit the capacitor on the outside unit and the compressor fan motor as well as having to add another cap when i replaced that fan motor the unit was not very well taken care off before i bought the house and i was told by a tech that the unit was on its way out when i replaced the compressor fan motor something about pressures being off etc about or months ago anyway the compressor and fan turn on with the contactor engaging then after seconds the contactor disengages and it turns off after a few minutes this repeats i m assuming it did this all day until it stopped doing it for some reason but i didnt want to allow it to continue so i turned the tstat off any suggestions thanks in advance here s the reason i think i must use the type of unit in the pic attached my ac and heat come from the same unit the heating coils for steam heat are in place above the unit and the units blow air over the coils for heat in the winter additionally my units are wide and it seems most of the ones i see online are larger than that if units like what i need can

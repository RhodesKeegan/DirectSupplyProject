unchanged for longer than that it collects a thick layer of dust and other pollutants these pollutants then build up on the filter and blow off into the air stream this buildup also restricts airflow through the filter and the coils causing undue pressure on the compressor over time this pressure shortens the life of your compressor which can make for a costly repairfrozen coilsmost of the time if the unit is leaking or spitting water it isn’t installed correctly during the cooling process ptacs will create condensation on the coils that condensation then drips off into a drain pan at the bottom of the unit if installed correctly into the wall sleeve the unit should be tilted slightly backward by a few degrees so that water in the pan drains to the outside\\xa0a unit that is tilted slightly forward may allow the fan to blow water droplets through the front grill otherwise it might simply leak out of the bottom of the unit onto the floor to fix this start by checking the angle of your unit and tilting it back if necessary while different manufacturers have their own recommendations angling your unit about 2° toward the outside is often a best practicemost common repairsyour

encounter them one day here are a few less common repairs you’ll want to consider during troubleshooting\\n 2refrigerant coils typically freeze because they haven’t been cleaned in a long time if this is the case you simply need to take the unit outside and clean the coils before reinstalling itafter this our repair technicians will check some of the most important mechanical parts and make sure they are working properly:\\xa0the compressor is often the toughest part of your ptac unit in fact it should last the full lifespan of your unit unless it gets damaged or poor maintenance affects its performance\\n 3in other cases it might be an issue with a small refrigerant leak if you’re able to patch up the coils yourself you can install a piercing valve on the suction side of your unit to add more refrigerant then you will need to weld it together afterwardbe sure to check the owner’s manual for your ptac model troubleshooting steps will often be listed there from the manufacturer along with some common repair scenariosalthough knowing how to repair a ptac unit is useful information good maintenance practices will help preserve the longevity of your unit and prevent the need for extra repairs in fact a well-maintained ptac unit should last 18 to 20 years\\n 4when we repair coil leaks at our facilities our technicians will cut off the line to the leaking side of the coils to install an access port we will then fill the unit with more refrigerant and clamp it back up using a pinching tool this pinching tool allows us to weld up the hole and seal it tight when it’s complete

to clean the coils it is a messy process that’s far easier to manage outdoors it’s good to use a cleaning solution in addition to warm water any off-the-shelf cleaning product will work but you want

the longevity of your unit and prevent the need for extra repairs in fact a well-maintained ptac unit should last 18 to 20 years\\n 9things like mulch brush leaves and paint can all get lodged in the back of the coils and clog them up this also makes it more difficult for air to flow through the unit creating extra pressure on the compressor and shortening its lifespan while you can still decorate the outside of your building be sure to either complete those projects before you install your units or clean your ptacs soon afterwardtypically your filter should be changed out or cleaned if

unless you are able to change out the coils yourself this is usually a professional repair job even then you are probably better off to scrap the unit and purchase a new or refurbished unit for around the same pricealthough many parts on your ptac can simply be replaced some problems are just too difficult to fix many repair technicians would agree that repairing a constant refrigerant leak can be nearly impossible while a small leak is often manageable a large or persistent leak that continues to happen for weeks even after initial repairs is often not worth fixing\\xa0\\n 11this is because

itanyhow any help is completely appreciatedthanks\\n 4\\n \\n by the way - the coil in the picture i posted is actually the heating coil and not attached to the ptac unit the coils on the ac were perfectly clean\\n i have an older amana unit  when i came home from work tonight the inside unit blower was running and outside was not  i reset all the breakers and outside unit turns on and 7 seconds later turns off  inside unit continues to run  over the last 3 years i have replaced the inside blower motor and fan one of the circuit boards on the inside unit the capacitor on the outside unit and the compressor fan motor as well as having to add another cap when i replaced that fan motor  the unit was not very well taken care off before i bought the house and i was told by a tech that the unit was on its way out when i replaced the compressor fan motor something about pressures being off etc about 3 or 4 months ago  anyway the compressor and fan turn on with the contactor engaging then after 7 seconds the contactor disengages and it turns off after a few minutes this repeats  im assuming it did this all day until it stopped doing it for some reason but i didnt want to allow it to continue so i turned the tstat off  any suggestions? thanks in advance\\n 5\\n \\n heres the reason i think i must use the type of unit in the pic attached my ac and heat come from the same unit the heating coils for steam heat are in place above the unit and the units blow air over the coils for heat in the winter additionally my units are 36 wide and it seems most of the ones i see online are larger than that if units like what i need can be had for $800 online please give me a link thanks!\\n \\n 6\\n \\n the top steam coil looks pretty old and dirty and may be restricting discharge air into the room are you running it at the hi fan spend? also does the unit short cycle? meaning is it constantly shutting off then back on for a short period and then off again?\\n \\n 7\\n \\n what is the model # of your existing ice cap unit? there are a few different versions and variations of the 36 and how it fits into the sleeve you will want to make sure you are ordering the correct version or else you will have problems fitting the new unit into the sleeve as an exact fit also keep in mind that the building is supplying the steam heat through the coil at their expense so your only electric bill liability in heating mode is running the indoor blower motor which is minimal if you convert to electric heat you will then be paying the electric heat in your bill during heating operationjust something to keep in mind\\n \\n 8\\n \\n yes the steam heating coil is definitely old and dirty doesnt seem to be hindering the air too much but i may look into replacing it and true re: electric heat my preference is to find a unit that can use the buildings steam talking with someone who might be able to sell me a unit now\\n \\n 9\\n \\n hi this particular unit heats fairly well one of my other units was having a heating problem similar to yours a few years ago turned out the air blowing over the coil was coming out too forcefully and causing the coil not to heat all the way i had to have a dimmer switch put on the fan in the unit so that in the winter i could turn the fan speed down at low speeds the coil heated up just fine i have no idea whether this might be the case for your unit as well but that was my story hope you get it fixed - this stuff can be uber frustrating!\\n \\n', '0as the air is cooled down by the condensing coils the trapped air moisture

air begins to be conditioned via the refrigeration process step 1: the system refrigerant commonly freon or puron begins the cycle in a gaseous state the compressor pumps the refrigerant gas up to a high pressure and temperature compressing it step 2: the gas enters a heat exchanger where it loses heat to the outside world cools and condenses into a liquid via the condenser note: the liquid is cold in this phase of the cycle step 3: the liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it evaporates as it does so it absorbs heat from the inside air where it is hot and muggy

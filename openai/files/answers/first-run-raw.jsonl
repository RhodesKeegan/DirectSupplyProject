{"text": "0,Changing/Cleaning the Filter,,\"Typically, your filter should be changed out or cleaned (if reusable) every 30 days. When your filter goes unchanged for longer than that, it collects a thick layer of dust and other pollutants. These pollutants then build up on the filter and blow off into the air stream. This buildup also restricts airflow through the filter and the coils, causing undue pressure on the compressor. Over time, this pressure shortens the life of your compressor, which can make for a costly repair.\",,,,,Frozen Coils,,\"Most of the time, if the unit is leaking or spitting water, it isn\u2019t installed correctly. During the cooling process, PTACs will create condensation on the coils. That condensation then drips off into a drain pan at the bottom of the unit. If installed correctly into the wall sleeve, the unit should be tilted slightly backward by a few degrees so that water in the pan drains to the outside.\u00a0\",,,,,,,\"A unit that is tilted slightly forward may allow the fan to blow water droplets through the front grill. Otherwise, it might simply leak out of the bottom of the unit onto the floor. To fix this, start by checking the angle of your unit and tilting it back if necessary.

When your filter goes unchanged for longer than that, it collects a thick layer of dust and other pollutants. These pollutants then build up on the filter and blow off into the air stream. This buildup also restricts airflow through the filter and the coils, causing undue pressure on the compressor.

It\u2019s best to replace the entire control board, which you can do without taking the unit out of the wall.\",,,,,,,,,,,\n 6,,,,,,,,,,\"As outside air continues to blow through the refrigerant coils, they can build up dust and debris just like the air filter. For this reason, it\u2019s important to clean the coils on your PTAC unit at least once every year (if not every six months). This prevents them from freezing or creating pressure on other parts of the unit from restricted airflow.\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,\"Other problems related to moisture and improper maintenance may not happen as often if you take good care of your unit.

It\u2019s good to use a cleaning solution in addition to warm water. Any off-the-shelf cleaning product will work, but you want to make sure the cleaner is made specifically for HVAC parts.

We bypassed the relay to have the fan run all the time until new relay could be installed. After a day the fan motor will run, but only if the system itself is set to \u201coff\u201d.  If I switch the system to \u201ccool\u201d on the thermostat the fan motor shuts off (outside unit still comes on). Any ideas?

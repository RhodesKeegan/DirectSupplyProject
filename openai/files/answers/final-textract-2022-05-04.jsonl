The owner must be familiar with these features in order to fully understand the operation and capability of the unit. Intelligence - Your Premium unit has an on board computer that utilizes real time diagnostics to prolong the life of your unit. There is an LED indicator on the control board, behind the front panel, that will flash an error code if the unit has detected some kind of fault condition. In many cases, the unit will automatically clear the fault condition and continue operating with no interruption. In some cases, the condition cannot be cleared and the unit will require service. In those cases, an \"Fx\" failure mode will be displayed on the digital display. For a detailed list Fig. 2 of all error codes and \"Fx\" conditions, see Table 6 -Status LED Indicator Definitions for further details. Memory - Your Premium unit also has memory. If power is lost, all of the control settings (setpoint, mode, fan speed, on/off and configuration) are remembered. So when power is restored, the unit will start back up in the mode (and configuration) it was in, when power was lost. Premium Sound - The unit not only doe S it have 2 fan motors and a tangential blower wheel for optimum sound, the outdoor fan will always run a minimum of 10 seconds before the compressor, to help reduce any compressor starting noise. Random Compressor restart - To help prevent power surges after a power outage (from many of your PTACs starting at the same time), the compressor is equipped with a \"165 to 195\"random restart delay feature. Whenever the unit is plugged in, or power has been restarted, a random compressor restart will occur. Compressor Protection - To prevent short cycling of the compressor and maximize it's life, there is a random start-up delay of 3 minutes on the compressor and a minimum compressor run time of 3 minutes. Automatic roomfreeze protection - automatically will keep the temperature in the room from getting too cold, where water pipes might freeze. If the unit is configured for the freeze protection feature to be active (which is the default condition), then whenever power is supplied to the unit, if the unit senses temperature below 40\u00b0F, the fan motor and electric heater are turned on and will warm the room to 50. If Freeze protection is not required, change the configuration switch to turn the feature off (see section on unit configuration). Automatic Quick Warm-up (for heat pump models only) - If the room temperature falls to 5\u00b0F below the set point temperature, the reverse cycle heat is shut off and the electric strip heat is turned on. 1. Mode indicator display: When the air conditioner operates in a certain mode, the corresponding mode indicator will be bright; 2. The ON /OFF indicator is in green when the controller is ON and in red when controller is OFF. 3. Fan speed display: When air conditioner operates at high, medium, low or auto fan speed, the corresponding indicator will be bright. 4. Dua-8 display: Ambient temperature can also be displayed in cooling and heating modes through setting the dial switch. Under cooling or heating mode, the dual-8 will display the set temperature (the dual-8 will display indoor ambient temperature under fan mode). 5. If the display data has three bits, the dual-8 will display \"ten's digit\"+ \"unit's digit\" at first and then display \"BLANK\"+ \"hundred's digit\". for one cycle, until heating is satisfied. Dual-8 Display and LED Display -- Two 8-segment nixie tubes, eleven LED indicators (They are HIGH,LOW,AUTO,DRY,COOL,FAN,HEAT,ON/OFF,SETPOINT,INDOOR,TIMER) Configure Fan to Optimize Selected Application - Unit can be optimized to selected application by configuring the fan to run in continuous mode or cycle on and off with the compressor and electric heater (can be different for both heating and cooling modes). In cycle mode, fan will continue to run after compressor or electric heater stops in order blow off any residual heat or cool left on coil. 2 ", "metadata": "sample 1.pdf"}

Failure to follow this caution may result in equipment damage or improper operation. CAUTION: UNIT DAMAGE HAZARD. Improper wiring may damage unit electronics. Common busing is not permitted. Damage or erratic operation may result. 12 DIRECT SUPPLY Notes Use terminal 4-way for heat pump connection only. The PTAC has a built-in 3-minute compressor protection time. If the compressor protection time on the thermostat is set for less than 3 minutes, the default PTAC 3-minute compressor protection time will take precedence. If connecting thermostat to a heat pump unit, thermostat must be set to heat pump operation, with the 4-way valve connection set to be energized in heat mode. For thermostats that have only one fan speed output (on or auto), the fan speed is determined by how the terminal connector is wired. If low fan is desired, wire the G output from the thermostat to (LOW-FAN) on the unit's terminal block. If high fan is desired, wire the G output from the thermostat to (HI-FAN) on the unit's terminal block. A connected thermostat will only control the set temperature of the PTAC within the temperature range setting of the PTAC. For 15k BTU resistance heat units: if the wall thermostat only has one electrical heater output, connect heater output to HEAT1; jumper HEAT1 and HEAT2 together Please do not remove the control panel.

The indoor fan runs continuously when the unit is operating in the cooling mode, unless the Smart ( Fan Auxiliary Control is set to cycle. This will cause the fan to cycle on and off with the compressor. You may also hear a fan noise stop and start. There are times when the fan on the unit will run even when the unit is not heating or cooling. If the system is set up to be in continuous fan the indoor fan will run regardless if the unit may be cooling or heating. Other times the fan will run longer than the heating/cooling cycle or kick on occasionally. This is normal and is done to improve room comfort and balance. If the unit is equipped with a make-up air ventilation system, fans will run continuously. Digital makeup air unit will perform a system check upon power up, power cycle, and once every 7 days if the unit is in occupancy mode. The system check lasts approximately 45 seconds. During this time the fans will speed up, slow down and then go to the set point. You may notice a few minutes delay in starting if you try to restart the Zoneline too soon after turning it off or if you adjust the thermostat right after the 3. Detay compressor has shut off. This is due to a built-in restart protector for the compressor that causes a 3-minute delay. During the defrost cycle, both indoor and outdoor SILENCE fans stop and the compressor will operate in the cooling mode to remove frost from the outdoor coil. After defrost, the unit will restart in electric heat to quickly warm the room to the desired comfort level. To protect the compressor and prevent short COMPRESSOR cycling, the unit is designed to run for a minimum PROTECTION of 3 minutes after the compressor starts at any thermostat setting. 49-7774 27 Notes 49-7774 28 Product Registration Follow these three steps to protect your new appliance investment: Complete and mail your After mailing the registration Read your Owner's 1 Consumer Production below, store this document in Manual carefully.

Figure 24 Replacing Front Panel 1 2 FRP024 18 Product Features The new Friedrich digital PTAC has state of the art features to improve guest comfort,indoor air quality and conserve energy. .Through the use of specifically designed control software for the PTAC industry Friedrich has accomplished what other .Manufacturer's have only attempted -a quiet,dependable,afforda and easy to use PTAC. Below is a list of standard features on every Friedrich PTAC and their benifit to the owner. DIGITAL TEMPERATURE By digitally monitoring the desired room temperature, the room is controlled more precisely than con- READOUT ventional systems. The large, easy-to-read LED display can show either the set point or actual room temperature as selected by owner. INDIVIDUAL MODE By having separate control buttons and indicators for both fan and mode settings, the Friedrich digital & FAN CONTROL control eliminates the confusion of previous digital PTACs. The accurate temperature setting provides BUTTONS greater guest comfort than other systems. The fan start and stop delays prevent abrupt changes in room acoustics due to the compressor energiz- QUIET START/STOP ing or stopping immediately. Upon call for cooling or heating, the unit fan will run for five seconds prior to FAN DELAY energizing the compressor. Also, the fan-off delay allows for \"free cooling\" by utilizing the already cool indoor coil to its maximum capacity by running for 30 seconds after the compressor. REMOTE THERMOSTAT Some applications require the use of a wall-mounted thermostat. All new Friedrich PTACs may be OPERATION switched from unit control to remote thermostat control easily without the need to order a special model or accessory kit. INTERNAL DIAGNOSTIC The Friedrich digital PTAC features a self-diagnostic program that can alert maintenance to component PROGRAM failures or operating problems. The internal diagnostic program saves properties valuable time when diagnosing running problems. FACTORY RUN-TEST Factory run-tested units reduce problems in the field. ELECTRONIC By limiting the operating range, the property can save energy by eliminating \"max cool\" or \"max heat\" situ- TEMPERATURE ations common with older uncontrolled systems. The new electronic control allows owners to set operat- LIMITING ing ranges for both heating and cooling independently of one another. When the PTAC senses that the indoor room temperature has fallen to 50\u00b0F, the unit will cycle on the fan ROOM FREEZE (high) and the electric strip heat to raise the room temperature to 55\u00b0F, and then cycle off again. This PROTECTION feature works regardless of the mode selected and can be turned off. RANDOM COMPRESSOR Multiple compressors starting at once can often cause electrical overloads and premature unit failure. RESTART The random restart delay eliminates multiple units from starting at once following a power outage or initial power up. The compressor delay will range from 120 to 240 seconds. CONDENSATE REMOVAL Condenser fan utilizes slinger ring technology to pick up condensate from the base pan and disperse it on SYSTEM to the condenser coil where it evaporates. This helps to cool the coil and increase the energy efficiency of the unit. 19 ", "metadata": "sample 5.pdf"}
{"text": "DIGITAL DEFROST The PZ-Series uses a digital thermostat to accurately monitor the outdoor coil conditions to allow the THERMOSTAT heat pump to run whenever conditions are correct. Running the PTAC in heat pump mode saves energy and reduces operating costs. The digital thermostat allows maximization of heat pump run time. INSTANT HEAT Heat pump models will automatically run the electric heater to quickly bring the room up to temperature HEAT PUMP MODE when initially energized, then return to heat pump mode. This ensures that the room is brought up to temperature quickly without the usual delay associated with heat pump units. The owner may choose between fan cycling or fan continuous mode based on property preference. Fan continuous mode is used to keep constant air ow circulation in the room during all times the unit is 'ON'. Fan SEPARATE HEAT/COOL cycle will conserve energy by only operating the fan while the compressor or electric heater is operating. The FAN CYCLE ability to set the fan cycling condition independently between heating and cooling mode will increase CONTROL user comfort by allowing the choice of only constantly circulating air in the summer or winter time (unlike other PTAC brands that only allow one selection). EMERGENCY In the event of a compressor failure in heat pump mode, the compressor may be locked out to provide HEAT OVERRIDE heat through the resistance heater. This feature ensures that even in the unlikely event of a compressor failure, the room temperature can be maintained until the compressor can be serviced. All CENTRAL DESK Friedrich digital PTACs have low voltage terminals ready to connect a central desk control energy CONTROL READY management system. Controlling the unit from a remote location like the front desk can reduce energy usage and requires no additional accessories on the PTAC unit. The frost sensor protects the compressor from damage in the event that airflow is reduced or low outdoor INDOOR COIL temperatures cause the indoor coil to freeze. When the indoor coil reaches 33\u00b0F, the compressor is FROST SENSOR disabled and the fan continues to operate based on demand. Once the coil temperature returns to 59\u00b0F, the compressor returns to operation. ULTRAQUIET The PZ-Series units feature an indoor fan system design that reduces sound levels without lowering AIR SYSTEM airflow or preventing proper air circulation. HIGH EFFICIENCY The Friedrich PTAC has been engineered so that all functional systems are optimized so that they work together to deliver the highest possible performance. DUAL MOTOR The dual-motor design means that the indoor motor can run at slower speeds which reduces sound levels indoors. ROTARY COMPRESSOR High efficiency rotary compressors are used on all Friedrich PTACs to maximize durability and effi- ciency. ALUMINUM Outdoor coil endplates made from Aluminum reduce corrosion on the outdoor coil common with other coil ENDPLATES designs. TOP-MOUNTED All Friedrich PTAC return air filters feature an antimicrobial element that has proven to prevent mold and ANTIMICROBIAL bacterial growth in laboratory testing.PXFTB replacement filter kits feature the same antimicrobial agent. AIR FILTERS All filters are washable, reusable and easily accessed from the top of the unit without the removal of the front cover. FILTERED FRESH Friedrich PTAC units are capable of introducing up to 30 CFM of outside air into the conditioned space. AIR INTAKE The outdoor air passes through a washable mesh screen to prevent debris from entering the airstream. R-410A REFRIGERANT Friedrich PTAC units use environmentally-friendly refrigerant. DIAMONBLUE Diamonblue Technology protects the outdoor coil from harsh environments. TECHNOLOGY BREAK-PROOF Break-proof control door design maintains the integrity of the unit.

Islandaire Manufacturer of Quality Air Conditioning and Heating Products www.islandaire.com sales@islandaire.com (800)-886-2759 INTRODUCTION OUR COMPANY Islandaire is the fastest growing specialty air conditioning and heating manufacturer in the country. Founded in 1992 by Robert Hansen, it has grown into a multi-million dollar company in just a few short years. Islandaire builds a full complement of high quality thru-the- wall replacement air conditioners and heat pumps, water source heat pumps, and gas units in East Setauket, New York. Each model fits perfectly into the existing original wall case assembly, thereby saving both time and money during installations. Our Engineering, Production, Sales and Customer Service departments have been fully integrated to provide the maximum degree of user satisfaction. We at Islandaire feel that this team approach to manufacturing produces a superior overall product and assures a larger degree of flexibility in design and production scheduling to meet tight prototyping or construction timetables. THE PERFECT FIT Thru-wall air conditioners were developed in the late 1950's. Over the next forty years many companies engineered, manufactured and installed a variety of different units throughout the United States and Canada. Today, a number of these companies are no longer in business or have discontinued their line of thru-wall air conditioners and no longer carry replacement parts. Islandaire offers replacement air conditioners and heat pumps that are interchangeable with units no longer available from the original manu- facturer. Our units are engineered to fit perfectly within the existing wall case, thereby reducing installation time and expense. They are manufactured at our modern 75,000 square foot plant on Long Island in New York.

{"text": "DR.PTAC INFORMATION The Dr. PTAC system is an add on system to our standard PTAC unit to provide conditioned makeup air into a space thru the PTAC unit by providing up to 75 CFM of outdoor air 24/7 by forced fan and cycling dehu- midifier compressor based on outdoor relative humidity levels. Dr. PTAC was created to solve issues with dehumidification in rooms and to introduce fresh air due to deficiencies of oxygen levels. Dr. PTAC is not only a PTAC but a Conditioned Make Up Air unit. New ASHRAE studies show that many illnesses in hotel rooms can be attributed to oxygen deficient atmospheres. Dr. PTAC solves that issue by introducing tempered conditioned make up air that satisfies both humidity level introduction and supplied oxygen. Dr. PTAC is a two-stage system. The primary unit is responsible for control of Sensible Heat that is intro- duced into the room via make up air temperature and thermal load of the occupants. The secondary unit is primarily a dehumidification unit that provides up to 75 CFM of outside fresh air into the room. The cor- rection of the Sensible Temperature comes from the main PTAC unit, which provides additional dehumidi- fication with temperature correction. Overall unit efficiency over standard PTAC's is approximately 3% improvement. The compressor/dehumidification process is controlled by a humidistat (factory set at 50% RH), which is monitoring the outdoor relative humidity level and is adjustable by a qualified servicer. When the outdoor humidity level raises above 50% RH, the compressor and dehumidification process starts. Below 50% RH, compressor operation and dehumidification is stopped, however, fan operation continues to provide up to 75 CFM of outdoor air into the space. The dehumidification system has a temperature switch which is monitoring both the refrigeration and the outdoor air temperatures. If the outdoor air goes below 38 \u00b0F, the compressor is disabled with fan operation continuing to provide outdoor air into the space. All dehumidifier controls and safeties are automatically reset. An optional air tempering heater is available for the fresh air system for applications where operation in cold winter climates is required. Condensate from the dehumidifier drains into the PTAC drain pan, where it is also slung onto the condenser coil for re-evaporation outside when the A/C runs. Excess condensate is drained into the wall case, which can then either drain to the outside through the louver OR is piped to a drainage system via an optional drain kit. ADVANTAGES OF THE DR. PTAC SYSTEM: 1. Lower installation/renovation costs than typical DOAS* 2. Decrease inconvenience to customer due to construction/installation of a DOAS* system 3. More humidity control in a room over use of a simple PTAC vent or Power vent system 4. Allows fresh make up air to travel entirely across sleeping and living areas of a room, exiting through a duct or under the door *DOAS = Dedicated Outdoor Air System Islandaire Manufacturer of Quality Air Conditioning and Heating Products . www.islandaire.com . sales@islandaire.com .

The air intake filters are removable for easy cleaning. A clean filter helps remove dust, lint, and other particles from the air and is important for best cooling and operating efficiency. Check the filter every two weeks to see whether it needs cleaning. 1. Turn unit off. 2. Remove each air filter by grasping the top edge of the filter frame and pulling each one up and out of the unit. 3. Wash in hot soapy water, rinse and shake dry. 4. Replace the filter, with the front of the filter toward you. 5. To dry the filter thoroughly, run your unit for a few minutes in fan mode. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE Keep air intake filter clean. Coils should be inspected periodically for build- up of lint, dirt, leaves, other debris, and bent fins. Clean coils with a soft brush and compressed air or vacuum. Do NOT use sharp objects to clean coils. The fan motors are permanently lubricated and do not require servicing. In areas of heavy snow and ice accumulation, snow and ice should not be permitted to accumu- late against the unit. As soon as practical after such inclement weather, clean snow and ice from around the unit as much as possible.

NOTE: Be sure to connect reversing valve wiring to the B (blue wire) connection of the thermostat for heat When the outdoor coil temperature is above 20 \u00b0F pump applications. (approximately 35 \u00b0F outdoor-air temperature), the heat pump draws heat from outdoor air and uses it to heat indoor air. Since heat is transferred and not pro- duced, the heat pump uses less electricity and reduces energy costs significantly. If the outdoor coil temperature falls below 20 \u00b0F (approximately 35 \u00b0F outdoor-air temperature), the unit automatically switches on a built-in electric heater. The compressor stops and a blower circulates warm air produced by the heater. When the outdoor coil temperature rises above 40 \u00b0F, heat pump operation resumes automatically. HEAT PUMP FEATURES Outdoor Thermostat: During the heating cycle, the outdoor thermostat senses outdoor coil temperature. It switches the unit to electric heat mode when the outdoor coil tempera- ture is 20 \u00b0F or below (approximately 35 \u00b0F outdoor-air temperature). The thermostat switches the unit back to heat pump mode when the outdoor coil temperature rises above 40 \u00b0F, which is enough to provide heat to meet demand. The entire operation is completely automatic. Islandaire Manufacturer of Quality Air Conditioning and Heating Products . www.islandaire.com . sales@islandaire.com .

Through the use of specifically designed control software for the PTAC industry Friedrich has accomplished what other Manufacturer's have only attempted - a quiet, dependable, affordable and easy to use PTAC. Below is a list of standard features on every Friedrich PTAC and their benefit to the owner. Digital Temperature By digitally monitoring desired room temperature the room is controlled more precisely than conventional systems. Readout The large, easy to read LED display can show either set-point or actual room temperature as selected by owner. When the unit is powered off the unit can be returned directly to heating or cooling mode by pressing the 'Heat' or One-Touch Operation \"Cool' buttons without the confusing power up sequence of some controls. One-touch control takes guesswork out of unit control delivering a more enjoyable experience and eliminating front-desk calls. The Friedrich PTAC/PTHP units feature two fan speeds and auto mode for the user to select from. This allows the Fan Speed Mode user to properly match the amount of airflow for their comfort level and also deliver's quiet performance. Individual Mode and By having separate control buttons and indicators for both fan and mode settings the Friedrich digital control Fan Control Buttons eliminates the confusion of previous digital PTACs. The accurate temperature setting provides greater guest comfort than other systems. The fan start and stop delays prevent abrupt changes in room acoustics due to the compressor energizing or Quiet Start/Stop stopping immediately. Upon call for cooling or heating the unit fan will run for five seconds prior to energizing the Fan Delay compressor. Also, the fan off delay allows for \"free cooling\" by utilizing the already cool indoor coil to its maximum capacity by running for 30 seconds after the compressor. Two-Speed Wall When connected to a wall thermostat the user can select from high or low fan speed at the thermostat, unlike Thermostat Mode competitive models that have only one speed selection. This allow more comfortable and quieter operation. Requires the use of Friedrich remote thermostat RT6 or equivalent thermostat with two speed fan output. Remote Thermostat Some applications require the use of a wall mounted thermostat. All new Friedrich PTACs may be switched from Operation unit control to remote thermostat control easily without the need to order a special model or accessory kit. Internal Diagnostic The Friedrich digital PTAC features a self diagnostic program that can alert maintenance to component failures Program or operating problems. The internal diagnostic program saves properties valuable time when diagnosing running problems. The self diagnosis program will also store error codes in memory if certain conditions occur and correct Service Error Code themselves such as extreme high or low operating conditions or activation of the room freeze protection feature. Storage Storing error codes can help properties determine if the unit faced obscure conditions or if an error occurred and corrected itself. Electronic By limiting the operating range the property can save energy by eliminating \"max cool\" or \"max heat\" situations Temperature Limiting common with older uncontrolled systems. The new electronic control allows owners to set operating ranges for both heating and cooling independently of one another. When the PTAC senses that the indoor room temperature has fallen to 40\u00b0 F the unit will cycle on high fan and Room Freeze the electric strip heat to raise the room temperature to 46\u00b0 F then cycle off again. This feature works regardless Protection of the mode selected and can be turned off. The control will also store the Room Freeze cycle in the service code memory for retrieval at a later date. This feature ensures that unoccupied rooms do not reach freezing levels where damage can occur to plumbing and fixtures. Random Compressor Multiple compressors starting at once can often cause electrical overloads and premature unit failure. The random Restart restart delay eliminates multiple units from starting at once following a power outage or initial power up. The compressor delay will range from 180 to 240 seconds. Digital Defrost The Friedrich PTAC uses a digital thermostat to accurately monitor the outdoor coil conditions to allow the heat Thermostat pump to run whenever conditions are correct. Running the PTAC in heat pump mode saves energy and reduces operating costs. The digital thermostat allows maximization of heat pump run time. 20 ", "metadata": "sample 7.pdf"}
{"text": "Instant Heat Heat pump models will automatically run the electric heater to quickly bring the room up to temperature when initially Heat Pump Mode energized, then return to heat pump mode. This ensures that the room is brought up to temperature quickly without the usual delay associated with heat pump units. Even Heat The digital control monitors indoor conditions to ensure that the room temperature is within five degrees of the setpoint. Monitoring If necessary the unit will cycle the electric heat to maintain the temperature. This feature ensures guest comfort by delivering the heating benefits of an electric heater while maintaining the efficiency benefits of a heat pump. The owner may choose between fan cycling or fan continuous mode based on property preference. (Note: Even heat monitoring and quiet start/stop fan delay only operate in fan cycle mode) Fan continuous mode is used to keep constant Separate Heat/Cool airflow circulation in the room during all times the unit is 'ON'. Fan cycle will conserve energy by only operating the Fan Cycle Control fan while the compressor or electric heater is operating. The ability to set the fan cycling condition independently between heating and cooling mode will increase user comfort by allowing the choice of only constantly circulating air in the summer or winter time. Unlike other PTAC brands that only allow one selection. Emergency Heat In the event of a compressor failure in heat pump mode the compressor may be locked out to provide heat through the Override resistance heater. This feature ensures that even in the unlikely event of a compressor failure the room temperature can be maintained until the compressor can be serviced. Desk Control All Friedrich digital PTACs have low voltage terminals ready to connect a desk control energy management system. Ready Controlling the unit from a remote location like the front desk can reduce energy usage and requires no additional accessories on the PTAC unit. Indoor Coil Frost The frost sensor protects the compressor from damage in the event that airflow is reduced or low outdoor temperatures Sensor cause the indoor coil to freeze. When the indoor coil reaches 30\u00b0 F the compressor is disabled and the fan continues to operate based on demand. Once the coil temperature returns to 45\u00b0 F the compressor returns to operation. Ultra-Quiet Air The new Friedrich PD series units feature an indoor fan system design that reduces sound levels without lowering airflow System and preventing proper air circulation. High Efficiency The Friedrich PTAC benefits from quality components and extensive development to ensure a quiet, efficient and dependable unit. Dual Motor Friedrich's new dual motor design allows for the quietest and most efficient units yet. Rotary Compressor High efficiency rotary compressors are used on all Friedrich PTACs to maximize durability and efficiency. Stainless Steel Endplates Outdoor coil endplates made from stainless steel reduce corrosion on the outdoor coil common with other coil designs. Diamonblue Diamonblue (seacoast protection) protects the outdoor coil from harsh environments. Comes standard on all Technology PTAC units. Top Mounted All Friedrich PTAC return air filters feature an anti-microbial element that has proven to prevent mold and bacterial Antimicrobial growth in laboratory testing. PDXRTA replacement filter kits feature the same anti-microbial agent. All filter are Air Filters washable and reusable and are easily accessed from the top of the unit without the removal of the front cover. Filtered Fresh Air Friedrich PTAC units are capable of introducing up to 75 CFM of outside air into the conditioned space. The Intake outdoor air passes through a mesh screen to prevent debris from entering the air stream. 21 ", "metadata": "sample 7.pdf"}

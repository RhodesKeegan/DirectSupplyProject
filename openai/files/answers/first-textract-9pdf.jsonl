{"text": "Important Safety InstructionsNOTE: The power supply cord with this air conditioner contains a current detection device designed toreduce the risk of fire. Please refer to the section \"Operation of Current Device' for details. In the eventthat the power supply cord is damaged, it cannot be repaired. It must be replaced. Do not use a productwith a damaged power cord. Contact Direct Supply Equipment & Furnishings to order a replacement.WARNING: For Your SafetyDo not store or use gasoline or other flammable vapors and liquids in the vicinity of this or any otherappliance.Avoid fire hazard or electric shock. Do not use an extension cord or an adapter plug. Do not removeany prong from the power cord.WARNING: Electrical InformationBe sure the electrical service is adequate for the model you have chosen. This information can befound on the serial plate, which is located on the side of the cabinet and behind the grille.Be sure the air conditioner is properly grounded. To minimize shock and fire hazards, proper groundingis important. The power cord is equipped with a three-prong grounding plug for protection againstshock hazards.Your air conditioner must be used in a properly grounded wall receptacle. If the wall receptacle youintend to use is not adequately grounded or protected by a time delay fuse or circuit breaker, have aqualified electrician install the proper receptacle.Ensure the receptacle is accessible after the unit installation.Do not run air conditioner without side protective cover in place. This could result in mechanicaldamage within the air conditioner. Do not use an extension cord or an adapter plug.Do not, under anycircumstances, cut,remove or bypass thegrounding prong.Power supply cord with3-prong grounding plug andcurrent detection deviceNOTE: The shape may be different according to its model:Power CardPower Supply230V, 15A230V, 20A230V, 30A265V, 15A265V, 20A265V, 30A4DIRECTSUPPLYOperation of Current Device (optional)The power supply cord contains a current device that senses damage to the power cord. To test yourpower supply cord do the following:1. Plug in the air conditioner.2. The power supply cord will have TWO buttons on the plug head. Press the TEST button; you willnotice a click as the RESET button pops out.3. Press the RESET button; again, you will notice a click as the button engages.4. The power supply cord is now supplying electricity to the unit (on some products, this it alsoindicated by a light on the plug head).Plug in & press RESETTEST -RESETNOTE: Some plugs have buttons on the topNOTES:Do not use this device to turn the unit on or off.Always make sure the RESET button is pushed in for correct operation.The power supply must be replaced if it fails reset when either the TEST button is pushed or itcannot be reset. A new one can be obtained from Direct Supply Equipment & Furnishings.If power supply cord is damaged, it cannot be repaired. It MUST be replaced by one obtained fromDirect Supply Equipment & Furnishings.When 265V units are to be installed, the power supply must be permanent wiring. Permanentwiring may be done through the accessory subbase. An exposed cord connection on 265V units isnot permitted.1-800-634-7328DirectSupply.com5", "metadata": "pdf1"}

{"text": "Air Conditioner FeaturesThis unit has many features. The user must be familiar with these features in order to properlyservice the unit.Compressor Restart DelayThis feature extends the overall life of compressor by preventing the short-cycling of the airconditioner. When the compressor restarts, the unit is designed to give a minimum of 3 minutes toequalize the refrigerant pressures for optimizing cycling.MemoryIf power is lost, all of the control settings (mode, fan speed, on/off and configuration) are stored.When power is restored, the unit will start back up in the mode and configuration it was in beforepower was lost.Automatic Evaporator Freeze ProtectionTo keep the evaporator from freezing, the compressor is turned off and the indoor fan is turnedon when the evaporator temperature is too low. If the evaporator temperature is not too low, thisfunction is off.Automatic Quick Warm-up (heat pump models only)If the room temperature falls to 8\u00b0F/4.5\u00b0C below the setpoint temperature, the reverse cycle heat isshut off and the electric strip heat is turned on for one cycle, until the setpoint is reached.LED Indicators and ButtonsThe touch pad has buttons for MODE, SPEED, CONSTANT FAN, POWER, SETPOINT UP andSETPOINT DOWN. It also has LEDs that correspond to the mode, fan speed, power and setpointoperation to indicate the unit's status. LEDs for HIGH, MED and LOW indicate the fan speed thatisselected.

Please contact your local electrical contractor, dealer or distributorfor assistance.Thermostat Wire RoutingProper Wire Routing Beneath UnitThermostat wire is not supplied with the PTAC.Recommended wire gauge is 18- to 20-gaugesolid thermostat wire.NOTE: It is recommended that extra wiresare run to unit in case any are damaged duringinstallation. Thermostat wire should always berouted around or under, NEVER through, the wallsleeve. The wire should then be routed behindthe front panel to the terminal connector.NOTE: Refer to thermostat installationinstructions for details on installingwall thermostat.Fig.3THERMOSTAT WIRE ROUTING(UNDER SLEEVE, BEHIND FRONT PANEL)Installation Instruction ofPTAC Wall ThermostatRemove the two screws as shown and take thecover panel off.Remove the two screwsTake the cover panel offTerminal blockTerminal block for thermostat connectionsTerminalDesignationFC(L)Front desk control terminal Le 000 e e e e eFC(N)Front desk control terminal NLOW-FANLow fan speedHI-FANHigh fan speed4-WAY4-way valve; reverse cycle (energized inheat) for heat pump modelsHEAT2Electrical heater 2HEAT1Electrical heater 1COMPCompressor24V(N)24VAC terminal N (neutral), common24V(L)24VAC terminal LCAUTION: UNIT DAMAGE HAZARD.

If the compressor protection timeon the thermostat is set for less than 3 minutes, the default PTAC 3-minute compressor protectiontime will take precedence.If connecting thermostat to a heat pump unit, thermostat must be set to heat pump operation,with the 4-way valve connection set to be energized in heat mode.For thermostats that have only one fan speed output (on or auto), the fan speed is determined byhow the terminal connector is wired. If low fan is desired, wire the G output from the thermostatto (LOW-FAN) on the unit's terminal block. If high fan is desired, wire the G output from thethermostat to (HI-FAN) on the unit's terminal block.A connected thermostat will only control the set temperature of the PTAC within the temperaturerange setting of the PTAC.For 15k BTU resistance heat units: if the wall thermostat only has one electrical heater output, connectheater output to HEAT1; jumper HEAT1 and HEAT2 togetherPlease do not remove the control panel.Recommended Wired and Wireless Thermostat Settings and ConnectionsDip Switch Settings for All Thermostats (U = Up, D = Down)S8S7S6S5S4S3S2S1A4A5S11S10S9XUpper BlueLower BlueUDDUUUDDUUUUDUDUConnections Between PTAC Terminal Block & Thermostat Terminal BlockPTAC Type/LowHiThermostat ModelBTU RatingFan4-WayHeat1Heat2FanComp24V(N)24V(L)Resistance HeatGLGH-W-YCR(7k, 9k, 12k models only)Pro1 WirelessResistance HeatThermostatGLGH-WWYCR(15k models only)Heat Pump (all models)GLGHO/B--YCRResistance Heat-G-W-YCR(7k, 9k, 12k models only)Honeywell PRO3000Resistance HeatWired Thermostat-G-WWYCR(15k models only)Heat Pump (all models)-GB--YCRFront Desk ControlThe PTAC can be remotely turned on and off via the front deskcontrol by applying a 24VAC signal across terminals FC(L) andDip switch for FRONTDESK CONTROLFC(N).

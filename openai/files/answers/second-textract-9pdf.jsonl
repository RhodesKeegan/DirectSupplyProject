{"text": "Important Safety Instructions NOTE: The power supply cord with this air conditioner contains a current detection device designed to reduce the risk of fire. Please refer to the section \"Operation of Current Device' for details. In the event that the power supply cord is damaged, it cannot be repaired. It must be replaced. Do not use a product with a damaged power cord. Contact Direct Supply Equipment & Furnishings to order a replacement. WARNING: For Your Safety Do not store or use gasoline or other flammable vapors and liquids in the vicinity of this or any other appliance. Avoid fire hazard or electric shock. Do not use an extension cord or an adapter plug. Do not remove any prong from the power cord. WARNING: Electrical Information Be sure the electrical service is adequate for the model you have chosen. This information can be found on the serial plate, which is located on the side of the cabinet and behind the grille. Be sure the air conditioner is properly grounded. To minimize shock and fire hazards, proper grounding is important. The power cord is equipped with a three-prong grounding plug for protection against shock hazards. Your air conditioner must be used in a properly grounded wall receptacle. If the wall receptacle you intend to use is not adequately grounded or protected by a time delay fuse or circuit breaker, have a qualified electrician install the proper receptacle. Ensure the receptacle is accessible after the unit installation. Do not run air conditioner without side protective cover in place. This could result in mechanical damage within the air conditioner. Do not use an extension cord or an adapter plug. Do not, under any circumstances, cut, remove or bypass the grounding prong. Power supply cord with 3-prong grounding plug and current detection device NOTE: The shape may be different according to its model: Power Card Power Supply 230V, 15A 230V, 20A 230V, 30A 265V, 15A 265V, 20A 265V, 30A 4 DIRECT SUPPLY Operation of Current Device (optional) The power supply cord contains a current device that senses damage to the power cord. To test your power supply cord do the following: 1. Plug in the air conditioner. 2. The power supply cord will have TWO buttons on the plug head. Press the TEST button; you will notice a click as the RESET button pops out. 3. Press the RESET button; again, you will notice a click as the button engages. 4. The power supply cord is now supplying electricity to the unit (on some products, this it also indicated by a light on the plug head). Plug in & press RESET TEST - RESET NOTE: Some plugs have buttons on the top NOTES: Do not use this device to turn the unit on or off. Always make sure the RESET button is pushed in for correct operation. The power supply must be replaced if it fails reset when either the TEST button is pushed or it cannot be reset. A new one can be obtained from Direct Supply Equipment & Furnishings. If power supply cord is damaged, it cannot be repaired. It MUST be replaced by one obtained from Direct Supply Equipment & Furnishings. When 265V units are to be installed, the power supply must be permanent wiring. Permanent wiring may be done through the accessory subbase. An exposed cord connection on 265V units is not permitted. 1-800-634-7328 DirectSupply.com 5 ", "metadata": "pdf1"}

{"text": "Air Conditioner Features This unit has many features. The user must be familiar with these features in order to properly service the unit. Compressor Restart Delay This feature extends the overall life of compressor by preventing the short-cycling of the air conditioner. When the compressor restarts, the unit is designed to give a minimum of 3 minutes to equalize the refrigerant pressures for optimizing cycling. Memory If power is lost, all of the control settings (mode, fan speed, on/off and configuration) are stored. When power is restored, the unit will start back up in the mode and configuration it was in before power was lost. Automatic Evaporator Freeze Protection To keep the evaporator from freezing, the compressor is turned off and the indoor fan is turned on when the evaporator temperature is too low. If the evaporator temperature is not too low, this function is off. Automatic Quick Warm-up (heat pump models only) If the room temperature falls to 8\u00b0F/4.5\u00b0C below the setpoint temperature, the reverse cycle heat is shut off and the electric strip heat is turned on for one cycle, until the setpoint is reached. LED Indicators and Buttons The touch pad has buttons for MODE, SPEED, CONSTANT FAN, POWER, SETPOINT UP and SETPOINT DOWN. It also has LEDs that correspond to the mode, fan speed, power and setpoint operation to indicate the unit's status. LEDs for HIGH, MED and LOW indicate the fan speed that is selected. LEDs for FAN, COOL and HEAT indicate what operating mode is active. LED for POWER is the unit ON/OFF status LED. If the unit is in ON mode, the LED will be green. If the unit is OFF, the LED will be off. High Temperature Protection In Heating Operation The compressor and/or electric heater will be switched off to prevent damage if the indoor temperatures are too high or the indoor temperature sensor fails.

{"text": "Electric Heat Only (for heat pump unit only) Switch S1 This setting is typically used for Emergency Heating. Wall Thermostat Enable Switch S3 A wired wall thermostat can be connected to the unit. If it is, this dip switch must be moved to the Wall Thermostat Enable Position before the wall thermostat will begin control. Setpoint Temperature Limit Switches S4 and S5 Provide a restricted range of temperature control within 4 ranges: 61\u00b0 86\u00b0F 65\u00b0 78\u00b0F 63\u00b0 80\u00b0F 68\u00b0 75\u00b0F Heat and Cool Fan CON/CYC Switches S6 and S7 Allow the fan to operate in continuous or cycle modes while the unit is in heating and cooling mode. CON (Continuous) Allows the fan to run continuously, circulating air even when the temperature setting has been met. This switch helps maintain the room temperature closer to the thermostat setting. CYC (Cycle) This setting allows the fan to cycle on and off with the compressor or electric heater. The fan stops a short time after the temperature setting is met. Low Temp Protection (optional) Switch S8 If the unit senses a room temperature below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C), the fan motor and electric strip heat will turn on and warm the room to 40\u00b0F (4.4\u00b0C). The fan will turn off after the room temperature has been warmed to 40\u00b0F. 1-800-634-7328 DirectSupply.com 11 Wall Thermostat Terminal IMPORTANT: Only trained, qualified personnel should access the electrical panel on the unit and install electrical accessories. Please contact your local electrical contractor, dealer or distributor for assistance. Thermostat Wire Routing Proper Wire Routing Beneath Unit Thermostat wire is not supplied with the PTAC. Recommended wire gauge is 18- to 20-gauge solid thermostat wire. NOTE: It is recommended that extra wires are run to unit in case any are damaged during installation. Thermostat wire should always be routed around or under, NEVER through, the wall sleeve. The wire should then be routed behind the front panel to the terminal connector. NOTE: Refer to thermostat installation instructions for details on installing wall thermostat.

Failure to follow this caution may result in equipment damage or improper operation. CAUTION: UNIT DAMAGE HAZARD. Improper wiring may damage unit electronics. Common busing is not permitted. Damage or erratic operation may result. 12 DIRECT SUPPLY Notes Use terminal 4-way for heat pump connection only. The PTAC has a built-in 3-minute compressor protection time. If the compressor protection time on the thermostat is set for less than 3 minutes, the default PTAC 3-minute compressor protection time will take precedence. If connecting thermostat to a heat pump unit, thermostat must be set to heat pump operation, with the 4-way valve connection set to be energized in heat mode. For thermostats that have only one fan speed output (on or auto), the fan speed is determined by how the terminal connector is wired. If low fan is desired, wire the G output from the thermostat to (LOW-FAN) on the unit's terminal block. If high fan is desired, wire the G output from the thermostat to (HI-FAN) on the unit's terminal block. A connected thermostat will only control the set temperature of the PTAC within the temperature range setting of the PTAC. For 15k BTU resistance heat units: if the wall thermostat only has one electrical heater output, connect heater output to HEAT1; jumper HEAT1 and HEAT2 together Please do not remove the control panel.

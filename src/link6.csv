It involves an inspection and a deep clean of the unit. If you are in an area with severe air pollution, we recommend getting a deep clean PTAC service quarterly instead of yearly. Getting quarterly maintenance is also advisable if you are using PTACs in a healthcare facility. Without frequent deep cleaning, the system will be unable to maintain optimal air quality to aid the recovery of patients. While you can perform yearly maintenance yourself, it is advisable to have a professional do it. There might be a need for heavy lifting, and a PTAC maintenance expert has the training and tools to perform the job thoroughly.</p>",,,,

The technician should also be able to advise you on how to improve your AC’s performance and extend its lifespan.</p>",,,,

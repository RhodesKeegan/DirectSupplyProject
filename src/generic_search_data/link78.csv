0,,,,,,,Air Filters,,,,,,,Copper Versus Aluminum Coils,,,had a step down transformer replaced it was fried by a surge last fall.Tech was surprised it didn‚Äôt take out mother board also. Turned ac on today and only the fan motor runs. No cooling at all. Is the board finally kaput.,,,,AC Condenser Fan Motor Not Turning,,,Another option is to take the board to an electronics shop and let them repair it. I seriously doubt it would cost 7 to 10k to do that.,"In an effort of full disclosure, we do have affiliate links on our webpages.

1,,,,,,,Goodman Air Conditioner Air Filter,,,,,,,Evaporator Coils Dirty Ice On Air Conditioner,,,"Live in Charlotte, NC. First hot day Saturday, high 91. The heat pump fan was not running, the air handler just recirculating air. Called our service provider. They came out and could not find a problem with the unit. He just flipped circuit breaker on and off. Then about thirty minutes after communicating this to us, the tech came back and said, ‚Äúas he was putting the screws back in the heat pump it switched off again‚Äù.  Said we needed a new circuit board and would have to order. It is two days later and the unit is running fine. Are we being scammed. The cost of this repair is over $800. including the part.

3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Presumably had a relay go bad on the circuit board. We bypassed the relay to have the fan run all the time until new relay could be installed. After a day the fan motor will run, but only if the system itself is set to ‚Äúoff‚Äù.  If I switch the system to ‚Äúcool‚Äù on the thermostat the fan motor shuts off (outside unit still comes on). Any ideas? Should we replace relay or proceed to replacing the whole board?",,,,,,,"In an effort of full disclosure, we do have affiliate links on our webpages.

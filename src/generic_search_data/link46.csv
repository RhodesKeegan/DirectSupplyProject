0,,,,,,,,,,It has to be the condensate in the bottom pan not fully draining out  and the dust and dirt is growing things and turning sour.  The air  flow goes right back over that water.The AC unit also has to have a  small drop in the back side to make the condensed water  drain  out. The rear drain hole needs to be checked for blockage. I   drilled four or five more holes in the rear bottom of my window unit. I  had to be sure I didn't drill into the condenser coil or any component.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ok, problems here with this a/c thread.....yes the air will smell bad coming out of window units if they are not cleaned every year, and they have to hold water in the back pan to help remove the heat from the freon lines and keep the compressor cooled down....the reason for the smell is lack of maintance on the unit....repair all of the holes drilled in the pan with some sort of epoxy, this pan has to hold the water that drains from the front evaperator area, your problem is not the water being retained in the unit but not having the units cleaned every year,  The window units have built in over flows for when the humidity is high and the pan gets too full,  but the unit has to have this water for proper cooling....if you do not repair those holes to allow the water to collect in the back pan area you will be having a compressor problem sooner than later as it will be overheating and burning out internally.","Ok,  problems here with this a/c thread.....yes the air will smell bad  coming out of window units if they are not cleaned every year, and they  have to hold water in the back pan to help remove the heat from the  freon lines and keep the compressor cooled down....the reason for the  smell is lack of maintance on the unit....repair all of the holes  drilled in the pan with some sort of epoxy, this pan has to hold the  water that drains from the front evaperator area, your problem is not  the water being retained in the unit but not having the units cleaned  every year,  The window units have built in over flows for when  the humidity is high and the pan gets too full,  but the unit has  to have this water for proper cooling....if you do not repair those  holes to allow the water to collect in the back pan area you will be  having a compressor problem sooner than later as it will be overheating  and burning out internally.",,DIY Appliance Repair Help,,,,,,,,
1,,,,,,,,,, You say you clean them? Was that with AC coil cleaner which has a  germicide to help kill the growth?  After I drilled the holes my  urine smell left town. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
